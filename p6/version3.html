		The dataset come from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic" target="_blank"><i>Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster</i></a>, a 101 type of machine learning competition hosted on Kaggle since it started.
		The task is to predict who would survive the disaster given information on individual's age, gender, socio-economic status(class) and various other features.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Each rectangle in the graph represents a passenger on Titanic, color red means that the passenger survived the disaster and the color blue indicates that he does not.</li>
			<li>There can be multiple people with the same age, gender, and class values, so I set the opacity of these rectangles to be 20%. The places on the graph where you can see solid red shows that those passengers have a higher chance of surviving, whereas solid blue indicates danger.</li>
			<li>You can move mouse over the rectangles to see deatiled summary information on surviving rates.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Based on this visualization we can see that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>females and young males(under age 15) from middle and upper class tend to survive.</li>
			<li>the overall survivor rate for female passengers is higher than male passengers.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>So, without all the drama shown in the classic movie, this visualization basically predicts that Jack will most likely not able to make it, but Rose will survive...</p>
