The area of map is the boston MA area.

The data file is downloaded from mapzen.

The link to the file is https://s3.amazonaws.com/metro-extracts.mapzen.com/boston_massachusetts.osm.bz2

The date I downloaded the file is Oct. 18 2015

The reason I choose this area of map is that I live right now at Waltham, which is 30 minutes drive from boston, and I went there often.
